We explore the application of convolutional autoencoders to generate pixel art. Our approach is twofold: first, we implement a standard RGB-based autoencoder model to understand baseline performance and highlight issues with current approaches - including those using very large generative models. Second, we introduce a novel one-hot encoded color mapping scheme designed to adhere strictly to predefined color palettes.
