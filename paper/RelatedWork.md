In https://www.sbgames.org/sbgames2019/files/papers/ComputacaoFull/197880.pdf the authors use Pix2Pix to build a model to transform an hand drawn image of a character into a (256,256,24) pixelate version. They use color quantization to constrain palletts but are careful to point out artists frustration with this methods accuracy "a considerable amount of noise still remained. Examples of rounding errors are shown in Fig. 12. For artists, fixing noisy images is a tedious and time consuming task"
